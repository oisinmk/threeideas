# Three Ideas

## Flavour combinations

### Overview

The culinary world can be an intimidating one.
The Taste guide will be the first comprehensive flavour guide app, inspired by “The flavour thesaurus” by Niki Segnet. 
The taste guide will be a visual learning experience for the novice in the kitchen to the experienced chef offering pairings and recipes.
Provides a break down of the flavour profiles in cooking to feed your creative side.

I think this would work great as an app, focusing heavily on a beautifully designed colour combinations and focus more on the visual side of things. I think it might be interesting to create infographics and a unique icon-set which could be sold as posters, t-shirts other merchandise etc.. 

I would need to get advice on how to get this project off the ground, learning how to make an app from the ground up which is the best platform to build apps on / programming language to take a stab at.  


### Pros
-	I have knowledge of Illustrator/Photoshop to develop my designs
-	I have a lot of experience cooking, and have a couple of experienced chef friends for knowledge and advice.
-	Everyone loves good food, I think there’s a desire with a lot of people to become competent cooks.

### Cons
-	My programming developing knowledge is next to none so I would need to learn from square one which is very intimidating at this stage.
-	I would need create a database of the different flavour profiles / possible extended information for each which would be a lot of information.



### How might it be built?
- From what I have looked at it may be built via swift, or using an alternate app builder platform- I need to do more research and ask more questions regarding this. An alternative may be to pitch/ and prototype the idea .


### Who’s it for?
-	Food enthusiasts, I like the idea of it being a tool that caters to novices for basic food pairings and taste profiles and also a handy tool for more experienced chefs to maybe provide quick reminders or help spur creativity. 
-	I need to create a solid design that is quick and easy to navigate. Targeted at an adult audience 16+, I want people to stay for the pleasure of the design as well as the information.



### What’s the business model?
Possibility of creating a one-time low cost, 3.99/4.99 or possibly offer partnering deals with advertisers. Could also create merchandise based on infographics. Icon sets. 


## Group saving service

### Overview
The hardest part of getting to that festival with friends is getting everyone to buy their tickets- How many plans have fallen apart, how many life experiences have you lost due to a few people of a group backing out of a festival, holiday, event because they havn’t saved up.

The group saving app is the new way to handle saving with your friends for that festival you’ve been dying to get to. 
The service will allow groups of friends to create a Target e.g (Festival) each member needs to save £200 – The app sets up a system for the groups to set (weekly/fortnightly/monthly)  deposit dates and shows when each member has deposited to the fund – (Michael has completed week 1) etc – The app is designed to encourage the users by sending notifications / Automatically direct debiting?) amounts at the pre-set dates / amounts ) Also making all deposits/ progress viewable by the group. This takes the hard part out of saving by doing it for you essentially. 

Another thing that the app will help solve is shared accomodation issues, localize all your bills to the group saver account as an alternative to bills coming out of one persons account and having to chase down what is owed / who paid what etc. set up exact amounts / divide by members of the house and the bills are sorted.
### Pros
-	Believe there’s a real market for this product, I have seen savings apps but none that offer exclusive group saving
-	Can be used by room-mates to remind / offer one place to pay utilities / bills in shared accommodation.
-	Clear paths for monetization through partnerships 

### Cons
-	Complicated in terms of where money goes, can this be connected to a group paypal? What technology would need to be utilized to keep track of deposits / money
-	Trust from user to deposit money? / Unless you gave user full control of money stored 


### How might it be built?
I would need to leran/build relationships with potential partners , airlines / travel agents / festivals etc in order to provide extra incentive.
I will need to research app building / paypal addons?

### Who’s it for?

Mainly target 18-35, housemates, friends, families – The idea is to work together for a shared goal, it allows simpler method of “who pays what bill” each month by splitting it evenly automatically.  Along with allowing groups of friends to reach that festival.. that team to afford that tournament. Creates a transparent platform for people to reach saving goals.



### What’s the business model?
Can incentivize the app by possibly giving % of total if target is reached over time?
Team up with Festivals / Airlines/ Travel agents / Excursions to offer discounts if saved / purchased through the app. Also advertising space for these related saving goals.
Or if discounts are provided via app usage, the app can take a small percentage of total saved? - need to work out the kinks



## Steps back to Excercise




### Overview
Almost everybody has had a period of inactivity for whatever reason (Injury, Accident, mental health, too busy, responsibilities). Fitness levels begin to drop, and motivation goes down. The thought of getting back into winning ways is a daunting idea. The steps back to fitness service is aimed to reintroduce exercise back into the users life, it’s reintroduce routine one step at a time, Can choose starting times/ exercises – as low as 3 minutes per day with the aim to increase little by little- (any activity is better than no activity) tracks progress – encouragement notifications - Advice


### Pros

-	Experience in researching exercise methods, benefits, techniques
-	Personal experience relapsing to inactivity and putting off getting back into the swing of things.
-	In contact with PT + nutrition masters graduate.
-	I have a strong interest in effects of exercise on the body

### Cons

-	Room for business model is cloudy
-	Saturation of Diet/Exercise apps – how can I make mine unique?
-	Need to learn software for creation


### How might it be built?
Can be built as a standalone app using swift programming language
### Who’s it for?
People recovering from injuries, wanting to start/too scared to start, busy lifestyle let themselves go whatever the reason and want to start again

I don’t think this should be a paid service, I think that creates another obstacle / excuse for people to stop getting back into exercise.
